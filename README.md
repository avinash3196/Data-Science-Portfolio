### 1. House Price Prediction Using Linear Regression Model
House is probably the biggest spend for most Indians. And  with urban population increasing manifold, buying a house  in a large city, which is where most jobs are likely to be, has  become difficult—the main obstacle being cost. Determining a  property’s value is difficult. The objective of the project is to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts house prices in Bangalore, leveraging a dataset obtained from Kaggle. The model is built to provide reliable estimates and be accessible to users through a web application for making informed decisions.

### 2. Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Algorithm
Segmentation is a very common practice, adopted by all organizations to achieve their objectives as it supports in setting up customized planning and strategies, making things more manageable and actionable. One such segmentation technique is the "RFM Model" widely used in marketing to segment the customer base based on their transactional behavior, here RFM stands for 'Recency', 'Frequency', and 'Monetary'. By analyzing each segment, a marketing team can make informed decisions to retain existing customers by improving customer experience, can acquire new customers, etc., thus increasing revenue and market share.

### 3. Stock Price Prediction Using ARIMA Model
The accurate prediction of stock prices will enable the investor to make well-informed decisions in current dynamic market. Effective forecasting will also help in managing risks associated with stock market investments, contributing to more strategic financial planning. The primary objective of this project is to predict the stock prices using Time Series Analysis techniques,  for which I have chosen Tata Motors company. Seeing people gradually taking an interest in the stock market in India, has motivated me to work on this project. The project entails gathering historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance, applying data transformation techniques, and leveraging ARIMA and AUTO-ARIMA models to make precise predictions.
