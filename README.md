House is probably the biggest spend for most Indians. And  with urban population increasing manifold, buying a house  in a large city, which is where most jobs are likely to be, has  become difficult—the main obstacle being cost. Determining a  property’s value is difficult. The objective of the project is to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts house prices in Bangalore, leveraging a dataset obtained from Kaggle.
